## CRUD Laravel 5.5 - Vue 2.5 Using Bootstrap 4

Simple tutorial to create a CRUD using Laravel 5.5 and Vue 2.5. In this tutorial we will use Axios, Font awesome, JQuery and Bootstrap 4. 

I mention that I have been guided by the Chizzoz tutorial:

- [Laravel-vue-foundation-simple-CRUD](https://github.com/Chizzoz/laravel-vue-foundation-simple-CRUD).

In this tutorial I use the latest version of the Laravel framework, as well as the latest version of vue js. also implementing the new bootstrap 4 framework, using cards, flex, buttons and modal.
